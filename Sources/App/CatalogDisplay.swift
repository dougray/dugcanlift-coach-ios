/// Every LIFT and Coach build that ships the catalogue follows these three, so
/// a recipe reads the same on each:
///
/// 1. **With no search typed, the list is the whole catalogue, by name.** The
///    kit's `browseRecipes()` defaults to a first page of 60, which left most
///    of the 622 recipes findable only by searching. The kit attaches every
///    page's ingredients in one query, so the whole catalogue is two queries,
///    not one per row, and the list that shows it is lazy.
/// 2. **A whole-number macro is rounded, never truncated.** `Int(224.5)` is
///    224; LIFT Android, Coach Android and both web builds print 225. Rounding
///    is half away from zero, `Double.rounded()`'s default. Display only: what
///    is stored stays the raw quotient.
/// 3. **A recipe whose source states no yield asks for its servings**, with
///    macros or without. Without macros there is nothing to divide, but the
///    count is still saved with the recipe, and a count nobody chose is a
///    number they did not pick. The per-serving macro line shows only when
///    there are macros.
